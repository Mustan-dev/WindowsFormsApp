🧾 CTF3204: Fundamentals of Programming
Coursework Portfolio – Login Form and Selections (Tasks 1–4) Module Code: CTF3204 Module Name: Fundamentals of Programming

🖥️ Project Overview
This repository contains a Windows Forms application developed in C# as part of the coursework portfolio. The project demonstrates foundational programming concepts including:

Form design and layout

Input validation and error handling

Event-driven logic

Navigation between user-controlled forms

Clean and responsive UI design using the WinForms framework

📌 Objectives
✅ Implement a login system with credential validation

🔄 Enable navigation between multiple forms

❌ Display error messages for invalid login attempts

🎨 Apply clean UI design principles

📚 Organise and present work to academic standards

📁 File Breakdown
File Name	Description
Form1.cs	Handles login logic and input validation
Form2.cs	Displays post-login content
Program.cs	Application entry point
Form1.Designer.cs	UI layout for Form1
Form2.Designer.cs	UI layout for Form2
Form1.resx, Form2.resx	Resource files for forms
WindowsFormsApp1.csproj	Project configuration and metadata
▶️ How to Run
Open the solution in Visual Studio

Build and run the project (WindowsFormsApp1.csproj)

Enter user credentials to test login functionality

🔧 Note: The compiled .exe file is located in /bin/Debug/. Ensure your system has the appropriate version of the .NET Framework installed.

🧪 Testing Summary
✅ Valid credentials successfully load the second form

❌ Invalid credentials trigger appropriate error messages

🔄 Form transitions are smooth and responsive

🧱 Application remains stable throughout runtime

🧠 Reflection
This project strengthened key programming skills in C#, including:

Designing responsive user interfaces

Managing event-driven form transitions

Writing maintainable and readable code

Publishing academic work professionally on GitHub

Challenges included mastering Visual Studio’s layout tools and ensuring proper version control. These were overcome through systematic testing and refining the GitHub workflow.
