🧾 CTF3204: Fundamentals of Programming – Coursework Portfolio
Assessment Title: Login Form and Selections – Tasks 1–4 Module Code: CTF3204 Module Name: Fundamentals of Programming

🖥️ Project Overview
The repository holds a windows forms app created in C# as a part of Coursework: Portfolio of Programming Activities. The project is known to exhibit the basic programming principles such as form design, input validation, event-driven logic, and user interface navigation through the WinForms framework.

📌 Objectives
Implement a login system with credential validation

Use navigation between user-controlled forms.

Display error messages for invalid login attempts

Apply clean UI design principles

Organise in academic standards.

📁 File Breakdown
File	Description
Form1.cs	Manages the logic of logins and input cheque.
Form2.cs	Displays post-login content
Program.cs	Application entry point
Form1.Designer.cs, Form2.Designer.cs	UI layout definitions
Form1.resx, Form2.resx	Resource files
WindowsFormsApp1.csproj	Project configuration
▶️ How to Run
Open Visual Studio solution.

Start the project (WindowsFormsApp1.csproj).

Run the application

Type in user credentials to cheque the login capability.

Note: The final file is the compiled .exe that is in the folder /bin/Debug/. Make sure that your system has the correct version of the.NET Framework.

🧪 Testing Summary
✅ Valid credentials allow access to the second form

❌ Invalid input triggers error messages

🔄 Form transitions are handled smoothly

🧱 Application remains stable during runtime

🧠 Reflection
The project enhancing important programming capabilities in C# such as:

Developing user interfaces that respond.

Handling events and transitions of form.

Organising code to be understandable and maintainable.

Professional publishing of academic work on GitHub.

Difficulties such as learning how to use the layout tools of Visual Studio and making sure that all project files were properly managed in version control were involved. These were defeated with a systematic testing and refinement of a workflow at GitHub.
